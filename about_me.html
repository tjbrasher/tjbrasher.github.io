                        My name is Travis Brasher and I am from Fort Worth, TX where I currently live with my wife and our two dogs, Juniper and Bubba. 
                        I am currently employed at a local commercial Audio/Visual integration company where I work as a System Designer and am
                        also a student at Colorado State University â€“ Global Campus where I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in Management
                        Information Systems (MIS) and Business Analytics, with a specialization in Computer Programming. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While I currently stay quite busy with work, school, and projects around the house, in my free time 
                        I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, listening to and playing music, playing games, reading, and am constantly
                        striving to continue to learn new things or sharpen and improve on the skills I already have. 

                        Some of these skills which have been acquired through both my previous work experiences and the coursework I have completed
                        include project management, leadership, an attenion to detail, analytical skills, and creative and logical problem solving.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am a highly motivated, goal driven and hard-working individual who consistently challenges himself to learn and improve. I have
                        a high attention to detail but have learned to prioritize tasks and projects. I am quick to learn and love being able to analyze
                        problems and develop creative solutions to them, making a career in an analytics or developer type role an excellent fits for me. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While I have enjoyed my time at my current company, I feel that it is time to expand my knowledge and skills beyond what my 
                        current company can provide and am working toward a new opportunity that will allow me to continue to grow, learn, and improve
                        on my analytical and programming skills. I am looking forward to to having the opportunity to transition to a career in
                        analytics or development and being challenged while being able to provide insights and help push organizations towards meaningful
                        improvements and changes, both internally and externally.

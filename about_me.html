                        My name is Travis and I am from Fort Worth, TX where I currently live with my wife and our two dogs, Juniper and Bubba. 
                        I am currently employed at a local commercial Audio/Visual integration company where I work as a System Designer. In 
                        addition to working full time, I am also a student at Colorado State University – Global Campus where I am currently 
                        pursuing my bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems (MIS) and Business Analytics with a specialization in
                        Computer Programming. While I currently stay quite busy with work, school, and projects around the house, in my free time 
                        I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, listening to and playing music, playing games, reading, and am constantly
                        striving to continue to learn new things or sharpen and improve on the skills I already have.

                        Starting My Secondary Education & Recent Work Experiences
                    </h2>
                    <div class="divider_1"></div>
                    <p>
                        Upon graduating high school in 2011, I began studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) 
                        before deciding to change directions and continue my education at Tarrant County College (TCC) while I decided on the 
                        career path I wanted to pursue. During this time, I held a couple of different part time positions while in school and upon being 
                        let go from one of my positions in November of 2013 due to downsizing, I decided to take some time to decide on how I wanted 
                        to move forward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this time, I continued to complete classes at TCC, and took up a temporary freelance contract position with a local 
                        audio/visual event company. After working with this company for a while, I decided to search for more stable income but wanted 
                        to stay in the audio/visual field as it was something I was familiar with and enjoyed. This eventually brought me to my current 
                        company, Electro Acoustics where I began my career as an Installation Tech in June of 2014. As an installation technician, I 
                        quickly grew my skills, learning to install systems as well as how to setup and thoroughly troubleshoot to prepare for project 
                        commissioning and turnover. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout 2014 and into 2015, I quickly worked my way up to a Project Lead position where I lead a number of projects
                        ranging in size from just a few thousand dollars to overseeing the AV installation for the largest project the company has done 
                        to date (Dickies Arena). While in this position I was responsible for leading teams in the installation of the AV systems as 
                        well as several project coordination and scheduling activities, including coordinating installation schedules and deliverables 
                        with stakeholders throughout the project. Additionally, I was often responsible for setting up, testing, and verifying system 
                        functionality as well as training the end users on the systems once the installation had completed
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after wrapping up Dickies Arena at the end of 2019,  I moved into the Design department where I continue to work as a
                        System Designer. Within this role I have many responsibilities, depending on the project and the stage of the project. Often 
                        times this means working with our sales team and project stakeholders to facilitate project requirements and constraints in 
                        the early stages of the project. Doing this helps us to determine the functional and physical requirements of the system that 
                        we will use to develop initial system designs that we can propose to the client. Additionally, as a system designer, I am 
                        responsible for both the conceptual and physical design of systems, working to ensure the projects remain within the customer’s
                        budget while maintaining as much of the original system functionality as possible by swapping equipment and proposing 
                        alternative solutions, working with the client and our sales team until a good solution has been reached.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        Within this current position, I have also tried to find ways to begin to be able to utilize some of the skills I have learned from 
                        my education and have recenlty developed an application that converts purchasing lists that are generated from our proposal 
                        software into purchasing lists that will be used by our purchasing department. This program was developed out of a need to
                        more quickly and efficiently create the purchasing lists and has been successful so far, though it is still in the early stages of 
                        beta testing within the Design department. However, there is potential for the program to expand and include other features 
                        in the future depending on the success of initial testing.

                        Recent Education - Continuing My Secondary Education
                    </h2>
                    <div class="divider_1"></div>
                    <p>
                        To further explain how I ended up continuing my education, I will rewind a few years, back to 2018. During my time as a Project 
                        Lead, I had begun to develop an interest in Project Management and wanted to sharpen and improve my leadership and project 
                        management skills and began looking into continuing my education. I felt that a formal education in Project Management would 
                        help to improve my project management skills and abilities, so I began to search for an online Project Management degree 
                        program, eventually finding my way to Colorado State University-Global Campus where I began working to complete a 
                        B.S. of Project Management. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after beginning this program, I took an operations management course where I learned about and practiced using data 
                        to analyze trends and forecast future demands for operations and products. This made me realize that while I enjoyed the 
                        leadership and teaching opportunities and tasks and responsibilities associated with project management, I was much more 
                        interested and passionate about being able to observe and utilize data to detect patterns and trends that could influence 
                        decisions and drive improvements and change. This realization prompted me to make the change from project management to 
                        begin pursuing the B.S. in Management Information Systems (MIS) and Business Analytics degree program, which I am aiming 
                        to complete by mid-September 2022.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of the MIS and Business Analytics degree program, I had the opportunity to take part in a basic programming course
                        where I learned the fundamentals and concepts of object- oriented programming (OOP) and the basics of Python programming
                        as well. This was my first time participating in any type of computer programming, but I immediately developed a fascination 
                        with it and added a computer programming specialization to my degree program to continue learning and expanding my
                        programming skills. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While I have enjoyed my time at my current company, I feel that it is time to expand my knowledge and skills beyond what my 
                        current company can provide. I am looking for opportunities that will allow me to grow and continue to learn and improve on my 
                        data/business analysis and programming skills. I am looking forward to being challenged while being able to provide insights and
                        help push organizations towards meaningful improvements and changes, both internally and externally. As I continue to push 
                        towards completing my degree, I continue to develop my analytics and programming skills and am looking forward to having the
                        opportunity to begin a career in business/data analytics.

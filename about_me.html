                        My name is Travis and I am from Fort Worth, TX where I currently live with my wife and our two dogs, Juniper and Bubba. <br>
                        I am currently employed at a local commercial Audio/Visual integration company where I work as a System Designer. In <br>
                        addition to working full time, I am also a student at Colorado State University – Global Campus where I am currently <br>
                        pursuing my bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems (MIS) and Business Analytics with a specialization in <br>
                        Computer Programming. While I currently stay quite busy with work, school, and projects around the house, in my free time <br>
                        I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, listening to and playing music, playing games, reading, and am constantly <br>
                        striving to continue to learn new things or sharpen and improve on the skills I already have.

                        Starting My Secondary Education & Recent Work Experiences
                    </h2>
                    <div class="divider_1"></div>
                    <p>
                        Upon graduating high school in 2011, I began studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) <br>
                        before deciding to change directions and continue my education at Tarrant County College (TCC) while I decided on the <br>
                        career path I wanted to pursue. During this time, I held a couple of different part time positions while in school and upon being <br>
                        let go from one of my positions in November of 2013 due to downsizing, I decided to take some time to decide on how I wanted <br>
                        to move forward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this time, I continued to complete classes at TCC, and took up a temporary freelance contract position with a local <br>
                        audio/visual event company. After working with this company for a while, I decided to search for more stable income but wanted <br>
                        to stay in the audio/visual field as it was something I was familiar with and enjoyed. This eventually brought me to my current <br>
                        company, Electro Acoustics where I began my career as an Installation Tech in June of 2014. As an installation technician, I <br>
                        quickly grew my skills, learning to install systems as well as how to setup and thoroughly troubleshoot to prepare for project <br>
                        commissioning and turnover. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout 2014 and into 2015, I quickly worked my way up to a Project Lead position where I lead a number of projects <br>
                        ranging in size from just a few thousand dollars to overseeing the AV installation for the largest project the company has done <br>
                        to date (Dickies Arena). While in this position I was responsible for leading teams in the installation of the AV systems as <br>
                        well as several project coordination and scheduling activities, including coordinating installation schedules and deliverables <br>
                        with stakeholders throughout the project. Additionally, I was often responsible for setting up, testing, and verifying system <br>
                        functionality as well as training the end users on the systems once the installation had completed
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after wrapping up Dickies Arena at the end of 2019,  I moved into the Design department where I continue to work as a <br>
                        System Designer. Within this role I have many responsibilities, depending on the project and the stage of the project. Often <br>
                        times this means working with our sales team and project stakeholders to facilitate project requirements and constraints in <br>
                        the early stages of the project. Doing this helps us to determine the functional and physical requirements of the system that <br>
                        we will use to develop initial system designs that we can propose to the client. Additionally, as a system designer, I am <br>
                        responsible for both the conceptual and physical design of systems, working to ensure the projects remain within the customer’s <br>
                        budget while maintaining as much of the original system functionality as possible by swapping equipment and proposing <br>
                        alternative solutions, working with the client and our sales team until a good solution has been reached.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        Within this current position, I have also tried to find ways to begin to be able to utilize some of the skills I have learned from <br>
                        my education and have recenlty developed an application that converts purchasing lists that are generated from our proposal <br>
                        software into purchasing lists that will be used by our purchasing department. This program was developed out of a need to <br>
                        more quickly and efficiently create the purchasing lists and has been successful so far, though it is still in the early stages of <br>
                        beta testing within the Design department. However, there is potential for the program to expand and include other features <br>
                        in the future depending on the success of initial testing.

                        Recent Education - Continuing My Secondary Education
                    </h2>
                    <div class="divider_1"></div>
                    <p>
                        To further explain how I ended up continuing my education, I will rewind a few years, back to 2018. During my time as a Project <br>
                        Lead, I had begun to develop an interest in Project Management and wanted to sharpen and improve my leadership and project <br>
                        management skills and began looking into continuing my education. I felt that a formal education in Project Management would <br>
                        help to improve my project management skills and abilities, so I began to search for an online Project Management degree <br>
                        program, eventually finding my way to Colorado State University-Global Campus where I began working to complete a <br>
                        B.S. of Project Management. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after beginning this program, I took an operations management course where I learned about and practiced using data <br>
                        to analyze trends and forecast future demands for operations and products. This made me realize that while I enjoyed the <br>
                        leadership and teaching opportunities and tasks and responsibilities associated with project management, I was much more <br>
                        interested and passionate about being able to observe and utilize data to detect patterns and trends that could influence <br>
                        decisions and drive improvements and change. This realization prompted me to make the change from project management to <br>
                        begin pursuing the B.S. in Management Information Systems (MIS) and Business Analytics degree program, which I am aiming <br>
                        to complete by mid-September 2022.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of the MIS and Business Analytics degree program, I had the opportunity to take part in a basic programming course <br>
                        where I learned the fundamentals and concepts of object- oriented programming (OOP) and the basics of Python programming <br>
                        as well. This was my first time participating in any type of computer programming, but I immediately developed a fascination <br>
                        with it and added a computer programming specialization to my degree program to continue learning and expanding my <br>
                        programming skills. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While I have enjoyed my time at my current company, I feel that it is time to expand my knowledge and skills beyond what my <br>
                        current company can provide. I am looking for opportunities that will allow me to grow and continue to learn and improve on my <br>
                        data/business analysis and programming skills. I am looking forward to being challenged while being able to provide insights and <br>
                        help push organizations towards meaningful improvements and changes, both internally and externally. As I continue to push <br>
                        towards completing my degree, I continue to develop my analytics and programming skills and am looking forward to having the <br>
                        opportunity to begin a career in business/data analytics.
